## study in the library

**Well**, I prefer to study at the library because it enables me to study more efficiently/ could help improve my study efficiency. **I mean** it is very quiet in the library and so I could **focus on** the things that I’m **dealing with like reading books, writing papers, preparing for exams and stuff like that**. And I am able to finish them all very quickly. But if I study in my  dorm, it will be very noisy because some of my roommates might be  talking on the phone loudly and some of them might be playing guitar or  something. And so I will **get distracted easily** and I will not be able to **concentrate** (108words).



## get prize in the competition

Well, when I was a freshman, I joined a music club on campus because I love singing. And I **signed up for** a singing competition on campus. Since it was my first time, I was **extremely** nervous.

## gap year

Well I think it’s a good idea for students to take a year off before entering college. **That‘s because** it can **help** them **take a break**. You know students were very busy back in high school. They had to **spend** at least 10 hours a day at school *attending classes, dealing with homework, preparing for exams*,  so they were **pretty** stressed out. Therefore, if they could take a year off, they could travel a lot where they are able to enjoy **beautiful scenery**, **taste delicious food** and **meet some new friends**, which will definitely help them **get relaxed**. And they will be able to focus better on their **schoolwork** after entering college.(115words)



## celebrity set example for young people

Well I agree with the statement that celebrities are good examples for  young people because most of them will devote themselves to charities  like making donations and so young people who like them are more likely  to do the same things. For example, several years ago, there was an earthquake  in Sichuan and hundreds of people got injured. When this happened, Jay  Chow who is a famous singer in China donated millions of dollars. I’m a big fan of him. So when I saw this news on TV, I also donated some of  my salary to support people in need.(95words)



## help neighbor

Well I agree with the statement that people can **get happiness from  helping others**. That's because in this way, they are able to **get a sense  of achievement** . For example, several month ago, my neighbor Mr. Smith had to go to Japan for a business meeting.  But nobody could take care of his dog and he didn’t want to leave it to  the pet shop. So he was very worried. When I knew this, I offered to  help him. He was very happy which made me happy as well. (94words)



## reduce air pollution

Well I think one way to reduce air pollution is planting trees  because trees are able to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen  through a process **known as** photosynthesis and so the air will become much cleaner.

**Besides**, I think people should choose to take public transportation like subway or bus because in this way the number of  private cars will be reduced and so there will be less carbon dioxide,  sulfur dioxide, or nitrogen monoxide in the atmosphere. So the air  quality will improve. 



## online shopping

Well I like to go shopping on the Internet because it’s very convenient. I mean I could just stay at home, choose the stuff I wanna buy like  books, then pay the money online. And after that I could just  wait for my package at home. But if I go shopping in a shopping center, I have to drive one hour to get to the nearest shopping center and spend  the whole day there shopping around from one store to another, which  is  a waste of time. (90words)



## writing papers

Well, I prefer to start writing all my papers right away because this is good for me. I mean in this way, I could have more time to prepare like **going to the library to read some books or getting online to collect some data** or when I have some problems, I could **ask the professors for help**. So I am able to finish them on time. But if I wait until the deadline, I might not be able to submit them ontime because of limited time, which  will hurt my grades.(93words)



## art and music

I agree with the idea that high school should require students to take art and music class.

Now let me simply explain why.

The first reason is that art and music class can help students to become **well-rounded** people.

The second reason is that art and music can help students to get relaxed. As we all know, students in high school are very stressed out, they need to spend up to 10 hours a day taking classes, doing problem set and taking exams, so they need to have a way to relax. Art and music can do this job. For example, when I was in high school, I often listened pop music on my cellphone, which help me relax a lot.



## review note

I prefer to review my notes regularly in order to do better in exams.

Now let me simply give you my reasons.

Firstly, reviewing the notes on a regular basis can **help me to find my problem, t**hat is, what I do not understand completely . If I just review my notes quickly just before the exams, **I may miss out many of them.**

Secondly, I will have less work to do during the final week if I review the notes regularly, which can **reduce my anxiety**. If I only review my notes during the final week, that's a lot of work for me, and I will be very anxious as I have so many work to do. But if I review the notes regularly, I can be more prepared.



## visiting museum

I prefer to simply look at the exhibits when visiting the museum instead of taking photograph.

Now let me simply explain why.

Firstly, taking photograph may prevent you from appreciate the exhibit. For example, I used to visited a museum in my hometown and see many visitors just take photos of the exhibit and then leave, without appreciating the exhibits carefully.

Secondly,
