## Travel

I 'm a big fan of travelling. Since I believe travelling can push me to broaden my horizon and see the world in a different way.

The problem of always being in the same place for a long time is that my world might get smaller.

So when I have time or money (有钱/有时间/因为 ... 省了时间/挣了钱), I will go to a different place to travel, and I can always experience something that I will never experience in my hometown/ if a keey stay in the campus all the time. And I can always be a better person afterwards.

## Internet

The Internet makes my daily life convenient for following reasons.

First, I believe that it is the easiest and cheapest source of entertainment. With a computer in front of me, I can play games, listen to music and watch the latest shows on demand. With the help of the Internet, I 'm always satisfied. 

Second, the Internet simplifies communication. For example, it used to take my mom days to receive a letter from my dad, who used to work in a faraway place. But unlike that generation, the only thing I need to do whenever I miss my friends or relatives is to give them a face-time call on my phone, and I can not only hear their voice, but also see their smiling faces within seconds, which is really convenient as well as time-saving.
